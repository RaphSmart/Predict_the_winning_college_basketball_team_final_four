# Predict_the_winning_college_basketball_team_final_four
This is a project that looks at historical data to see which team metrics (individually or in combination) make a team more likely to make it into the Final Four.
This is final practical project on "Introduction to Python and Machine Learning" course I took on Edx.

The following algorithms were used to build the models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression

The following metrics were used to get the accuracy of each classifier:
Jaccard index
F1-score
Accuracy
